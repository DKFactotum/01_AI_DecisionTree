Daniil Koshelyuk exercise on AI: Decision trees led by WelchLabs.

                                        THEORY

Steps:

0. Small size area sampling around the pixel to evaluate the task;
1. Simplify the problem with threshold;
2. Too specific -> more rules;
3. Evaluation: confusion matrix
        yes no
    yes  +   -
    no   -   +
    Difference between false positive and false negatives - important to track and distinguish the two.

History of AI:

- Rene Descartes (1596-1650):
                                          Automata as core of any animal (cogs, pistons and camps).
- Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716):
                                          Systematization of arguments by reduction to a specific number.
    + transistors
- Alan Turing (1912-1954):
                                          Mathematical logic -> Computer Program (but there is a limit to math logic)
                                          NB! Reference: 1950 Computing Machinery and Intelligence
- Marvin Minsky (1927-2016) + Gerald Sussman (1947-) - computer distinguishing images.
                                          Common ground between Computer Vision and Lot's of other problems (like play board games, avoid car crashes in self-driving cars, data mining, predict heart disease, detect bank fraud etc.)
- Helbert Simon (1916-2001)
